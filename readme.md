# Disclaimer
this "framework" uses most of the ro.py's code,<br>
thanks to them for writing it.<br>
i dunno how to properly write frameworks,<br>
so looking at their code and copying lol (sorry pls)
<br><br>
so, here the original roblox api wrapper: https://github.com/ro-py/ro.py<br>
also heavily inspired by vkbottle.

to install the latest unstable version of foxford wrapper, install [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and run the following:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/frostx-official/foxford.git
```
